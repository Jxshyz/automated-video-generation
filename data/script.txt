I need a fully formulated, long-form presentation script for a video presentation titled "Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, Gated Recurrent Units, Attention Mechanism & Transformers in Computer Vision."

Please make sure that the final script has about 2100 words.

This script will be used for two purposes:

Text-to-Speech (TTS) narration, which should read the spoken text naturally.
An external API for animations, illustrations, and mathematical formulas, which will process special markers to generate visuals.
Instructions for Text Formatting
Do NOT use markdown-style headings (e.g., # or ##).
Instead, introduce new sections naturally using phrases like:
"Now, let's explore..."
"Moving on to..."
"Next, we will discuss..."
Do NOT use bullet points. Instead, write everything as fully articulated sentences in a spoken format.
Do NOT include time markers.
Instructions for Spoken vs. Non-Spoken Content
Certain elements must be marked in double parentheses (( ... )) so they can be filtered out from the spoken script but remain in the text file for processing by an external API.

The script should embed the following types of visual instructions inside (( ... )) markers:

Mathematical equations: (( Equation: W_hh * h_t-1 + W_xh * x_t + b_h ))
Model structures & flowcharts: (( Diagram: RNN architecture with feedback loops and fixed weights ))
State diagrams & memory representations: (( State Transition: LSTM cell gates controlling long-term and short-term memory ))
Animations for concepts: (( Animation: Gradual vanishing gradient in RNN, affecting long-term memory retention ))
Illustrations for analogy-based explanations: (( Illustration: LSTM as a librarian filtering useful vs. unimportant notes ))
These should NOT be spoken aloud by the TTS system but must be included in the text output for further processing.

Structure of the Script
Opening
Introduce the speaker and the topic naturally.
Example:
"Hello and welcome. Today, we are going to explore how deep learning models handle sequential data and why this is crucial for computer vision applications."
(( Illustration: Computer vision pipeline with neural network models processing an image sequence ))

Now, let’s talk about recurrent neural networks. These are designed to process sequential data, meaning they take previous inputs into account when making predictions. Imagine you are typing a message, and your phone predicts the next word based on what you previously typed. This is exactly how recurrent neural networks work.

Unlike traditional neural networks, which process inputs independently, recurrent neural networks have a feedback loop. This means they use the same weight matrix at each time step and store past information in a hidden state. However, this structure has a major drawback—it struggles to retain long-term dependencies because of something called the vanishing gradient problem.

(( Equation: h_t = tanh(W_hh * h_t-1 + W_xh * x_t + b_h) ))
(( Diagram: RNN structure with feedback loop and fixed weight matrix ))

Moving on, let’s discuss long short-term memory networks. These were introduced to fix the shortcomings of recurrent neural networks, specifically the inability to retain information for long sequences. Long short-term memory networks introduce gates—components that decide what information should be kept and what should be forgotten. There are three main gates: the forget gate, the input gate, and the output gate.

(( Equation: c_t = f_t * c_t-1 + i_t * g_t ))
(( Diagram: LSTM cell with forget, input, and output gates ))

Gated recurrent units, or GRUs, are a simplified version of long short-term memory networks. Instead of three gates, they use only two: the reset gate and the update gate. This makes them computationally faster while still retaining long-term dependencies.

(( Equation: h_t = z_t * h_t-1 + (1 - z_t) * h̃_t ))
(( Diagram: GRU cell with update and reset gates ))

Attention mechanisms take things even further. Instead of relying solely on past hidden states, attention mechanisms allow models to focus on the most relevant parts of an input sequence. This is similar to reading a long textbook—you do not read every word with the same intensity. Instead, your eyes naturally focus on bolded words, highlighted sections, or headings.

(( Equation: Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / sqrt(d_k)) V ))
(( Animation: Attention focusing on different words in a sentence dynamically ))

Next, we will discuss how these techniques apply to real-world problems. For example, in sports player tracking, the ability to predict movements and behavior over time is crucial. Recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, and GRUs are often used to track players in various sports. These models can analyze the temporal sequences of a player's movement to predict future positions and optimize team strategies.

In medical applications, the ability to handle sequential data can be used for tasks like patient health monitoring or diagnosis prediction. Models like LSTMs can analyze a patient's medical history—such as vital signs or test results over time—and make predictions about potential health risks, improving decision-making in hospitals and clinics.

In autonomous driving, vehicles need to understand and predict the behavior of pedestrians, other vehicles, and objects in real time. Recurrent models like GRUs and attention mechanisms can track these dynamic objects and make real-time decisions that ensure safe navigation. The integration of attention mechanisms allows these models to prioritize the most relevant data, such as identifying an approaching pedestrian, over less critical elements of the environment.

(( Animation: Medical data sequence for health monitoring ))
(( Illustration: Autonomous vehicle detecting pedestrians with attention mechanism ))

Finally, transformers played a revolutionary role in handling sequential data, but we will focus on their applications in natural language processing and their influence on sequential models for vision-related tasks. While transformers' self-attention mechanism allows for significant advances in NLP tasks, in computer vision, the focus has shifted to using hybrid models that combine the benefits of transformers with recurrent approaches for handling temporal dependencies.

(( Equation: Self-Attention = softmax(QK^T / sqrt(d_k)) V ))
(( Diagram: Hybrid model with transformer and RNN components for vision tasks ))

Final Instructions for GPT API
DO NOT use markdown-style headings (#, ##, etc.).
DO NOT use bullet points.
DO NOT include time markers.
Use natural transitions to introduce new sections.
Include (( ... )) markers for non-spoken elements like equations, diagrams, and animations.
