I need a spoken-style script for a presentation about recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), gated recurrent units (GRUs), and attention mechanisms. The script should be structured based on the following slide order:

Introduction
Introduction to RNNs
The Structure of an RNN
The Vanishing Gradient Problem
Introducing LSTMs
The LSTM Cell Structure
LSTMs as Intelligent Librarians
Introducing GRUs
CPU Efficiency Comparison Between RNN, LSTM, GRU
Simple RNN, LSTM, and GRU Models
Future Directions
Key Takeaways
Mastering RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs
Introduction to Attention Mechanisms
Attention in Different Domains
Transformers and Their Impact
LSTM Applications in Healthcare
GRUs in Sports Analytics
Q&A Session
The script should be approximately 1100 words, ensuring the content is well-balanced and thematically aligned with this structure. It should be easy to understand while still using the necessary technical terms. The language should be clear and engaging, resembling a natural spoken presentation. The script should not include equations, headlines, or any specific formattingâ€”just continuous text that flows naturally as if spoken.
